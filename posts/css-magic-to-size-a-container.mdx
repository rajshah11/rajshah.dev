## What is a viewport?

The viewport refers to the part of the webpage that is visible in its window, and its dimensions are measured in _CSS_ pixels. Do not confuse this with the physical resolution of the screen!

Here are some examples of viewport widths -

| Viewport                                                            | Width (in _CSS_ pixels) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Fully maximized browser window on a 27 inch monitor                 | 2993                    |
| Browser window occupying 35% of the screen on a 27 inch monitor     | 1047                    |
| Fully maximized browser window on a 14 inch MacBook Pro             | 1800                    |
| Browser window occupying 50% of the screen on a 14 inch MacBook Pro | 900                     |
| Samsung Galaxy S21's screen                                         | 360                     |

## The trick

Below is the CSS I use to set the width of the central div that holds the content for this website -

```css
max-width: min(max(480px, 50vw), 100vw);
```

The code above essentially follows 3 conditions:

1. If 60% of the viewport's width > 480px, then use 60% of the viewport's width

   - _This ensures that for large windows or screens like a 27 inch monitor, the content of the webpage is not extended and difficult to read like first image, but compact, in-focus and easy to read like the second one._

    {
      path: "/posts-assets/a-simple-css-trick-to-size-a-container/2993_wide_viewport_100.png",
      caption: "Text occupying 100% of a 2993px wide viewport.",
    },
    {
      path: "/posts-assets/a-simple-css-trick-to-size-a-container/2993_wide_viewport_50.png",
      caption:

    },
  ]}
  numRows={1}
  colSizing="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg"
/>

2. If condition #1 is false and 100% of the viewport's width is < 480px, then set the width to 480px

   - _For medium-sized windows or screens, this ensures that we are using somewhere between 60% to 100% of the viewport's width, so that our content is not too extended or too congested._

    {
      path: "/posts-assets/a-simple-css-trick-to-size-a-container/585_vw_50.png",
      caption: "Text occupying 50% of a 585px wide viewport. Too cramped.",
    },

      path: "/posts-assets/a-simple-css-trick-to-size-a-container/585_vw_100.png",
      caption: "Text occupying 100% of a 585px wide viewport.",
    },
    {
      path: "/posts-assets/a-simple-css-trick-to-size-a-container/585_vw_480.png",
      caption: "Text occupying 480px i.e. 82% of a 585px wide viewport.",
    },
  ]}
  numRows={1}
  colSizing="col-xs col-sm col-md col-lg"
/>

3. If conditions #1 and #2, then use 100% of the viewport's width
   - _This allows the website to use all of the real-estate on a mobile screen._

Finally, below are some plots to drive home the message. Hope this was helpful!
