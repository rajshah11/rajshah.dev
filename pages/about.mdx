Hi, I'm Raj Shah.

As someone who has spent most of his coding hours working on backend systems, I bootstapped this website without any website builder or CMS to explore the world of frontend. This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) + [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) + [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) + [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/). I plan to over-engineer the heck out of this website in the coming months!

I am currently a full-stack engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) building tools and services which help safeguard Stripe and its customers from frauds and losses.

I will use this space to write about anything - programming, my life and everything else. Watching sports, especially football and chess, is my favorite pastime. I am also interested in the world of financial markets and wish to write about that too.

export default ({ children }) => <AboutLayout>{children}</AboutLayout>;
