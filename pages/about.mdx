import { AboutLayout } from "../layouts";

Hi, I'm Raj Shah.

I am a software engineer who specializes in building large-scale web services, high-quality APIs and robust data pipelines. I am currently a full-stack engineer at Stripe building tools and services which help safeguard Stripe and its customers from frauds and losses.

Before joining Stripe, I worked at Microsoft for 4 years, where I worked on APIs and systems to help customers manage their Azure subscriptions, and monitor their costs and billing.

I have been wanting to write more and ended up building this space to write about anything - programming, my life and everything else. Watching sports, especially football and chess, is my favorite pastime. I am also interested in the world of financial markets and wish to write about that too.
