# Hi, I'm Raj

## I am a software engineer who specializes in building large-scale web services, high-quality APIs and robust data pipelines. I am currently a full-stack engineer at Stripe building tools and services which help safeguard Stripe and its customers from frauds and losses.

### Before joining Stripe, I worked at Microsoft for 4 years, where I worked on APIs and systems to help customers manage their Azure subscriptions, and monitor their costs and billing.

#### I am also interested in the world of financial markets, football (the one that you play with your foot) and chess.
